# TM4C123GXL

The Tiva™ C Series TM4C123G LaunchPad Evaluation Board (EK-TM4C123GXL - https://www.ti.com/tool/EK-TM4C123GXL) is a low-cost evaluation platform for ARM® Cortex™-M4F-based microcontrollers. The Tiva C Series LaunchPad design highlights the TM4C123GH6PMI (https://www.ti.com/product/TM4C123GH6PM) microcontroller USB 2.0 device interface, hibernation module, and motion control pulse-width modulator (MC PWM) module. The Tiva C Series LaunchPad also features programmable user buttons and an RGB LED for custom applications. The stackable headers of the Tiva C Series TM4C123G LaunchPad BoosterPack XL interface demonstrate how easy it is to expand the functionality of the Tiva C Series LaunchPad when interfacing to other peripherals on many existing BoosterPack add-on boards as well as future products.
